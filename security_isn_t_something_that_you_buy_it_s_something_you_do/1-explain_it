1. I should create an SSH key pair, which includes a public key, and a
private key. I can use ssh-keygen command for this.

2. The public key needs to be placed (appended) to the authorized_keys
file (or equivalent) in the SSH server. This public key will be used
to encrypt data. This data will be unreadable to anyone without the
private key.

3. The private key should only be kept by you, and stored securely;
others should not have have access to it. When data is encrypted by
the paired public key, the private key will be used to decrypt the
data. The private key is engineered in such a way that prevents others
from deducing it from the paired public key.
